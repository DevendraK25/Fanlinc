Project Objective:

Build a social networking web application that connects fan bases of different genres with each other through public and private chat and forum features, along with maps displaying nearby events for fans to schedule and go to. This website offers fans a unique identity in order to find people with similar interests to connect and share their fan knowledge.

  

Key Users/intended audience:

-   Hardcore fans from a variety of fandoms
    
-   New fans curious about the fandoms and fan activities
    
-   Casual fans who enjoy watching content on their free time but not beyond that
    
-   15 and above (for safety and content concerns)
    

  

Scenarios:

-   It is a Sunday cool afternoon. Bob is a casual user of fanlinc, and has free time sitting around at home after watching an episode of his favourite tv show(Bojack Horseman). Bob checks the website from time to time, to see interesting and fun user-submitted content on coolest replays, or funny cosplays. He goes onto the site and it remembers his saved preferences. In the homepage, he browses through the most popular posts from the categories that he has subscribed to. He is subscribed to Bojack Horseman series and sees thrilling posts about conspiracies and discussions. He joins in too by commenting on the thread.
    

-   Saitama and King are gaming friends who only chat online. They use the website to chat about the newest games or mangas since they are really busy in the real world with their daily lives. Sometimes, they check on anime conventions near them to meetup and see all the cool cosplayers. King checks the events list on the site to find the nearest events to him. He shows that he is going to the site with his status as <going>. Saitama also sees this and he would love to join him so he messages king about the details through the app
    

  

-   John Deere (aged 32) has no background in fandoms and has never watched a tv show in his life. He wants to find a new hobby. He discovered fanlinc and went onto the site. He was greeted by a welcoming page along with sign up information. He fills in the required information as well as his hobbies and social insurance number along with his credit card details. Afterwards he is shown a variety of categories from different fandoms. He chooses a thumbnail that he prefers and is shown a lot of content. He is happy.
