new user story: As a user, I can comment on other posts and comments so that I can share my ideas and feelings with other fans.

The practices that we should continue during sprint2: 

Get touch with each teammate in group work to know the progress and any issue they met. Make a conversation after lecture's end with sharing experience and opinions to evaluate the system and features. Always check current process and update any new item in project.

The new practices that we might want to use during sprint2:

During the tutorial, be more active to ask quetion with TA and project holder, which let our team can obtain more advice and improvement from them. There will be some parts we didn't consider enough, so get the help from instructor is very useful in our team working.

The harmful practices we should stop using during sprint2:

Double check the branch in Git is available to run and each function is good enough to show. Remember to make sure the database, network and backend are running well.

The best experience during sprint1:

We succefully create the forum borad which is availeble to create post with subject and content with date time. During the programming, we learn a lot from database system in adding posts. We know deeper about how to deal with the connection between data and posts.
