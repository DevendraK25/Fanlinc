First,
- If you don't have angular-cli installed, in the frontend folder, do `npm install -g --save @angular/cli`.<br>
- If you don't have mongodb installed, in the new-backend folder, do `npm install -g --save mongodb`.<br>

To run program:
- Open terminal.
- cd to frontend folder and do `ng serve --o`, it takes some time to compile.
- Next, cd to new-backend folder and do `npm run dev`.
- Once the webpage opened, open web console by doing right-click and inspect element. 
- To test if it works, go to register page, fill in the fields and sign up. If successful, the message 'user created' should appear in console.
- Then, on login page, sign in with user info you just created and the message 'user retrieved' should appear in console.
