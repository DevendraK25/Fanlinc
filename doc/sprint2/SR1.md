Unfinished task from sprint1: Profile edit part
new user story: As a user I want to edit my profile so that I can change the profile content as i wish.

The practices that we should continue during sprint2: 

Hold a phone call meeting with teammates and communicate with each other for current process of project and exchanges each person's suggestion, which improves the efficiency in completing every task.

The new practices that we might want to use during sprint2:

Before the C01 lecture starts or after it ends, we can ask professor for help, like showing our demo and asking some advices from him about layouts, designing and programming parts.

The harmful practices we should stop using during sprint2:

Not run the demo in school's lab, which results that downloading required backend takes much time and we only used our own laptop to show the demo.

The best experience during sprint1:

We learned Mondo database and javascript in programming the project and deeped our knowledge and understanding in some useful functions and algorithm. Also the teamwork let us finish our own tasks with high efficiency and improve our discussion and communication skills.
