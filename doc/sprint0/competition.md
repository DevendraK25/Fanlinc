	- Open fan communities with stronger ties
	- Allowed greater creativity (under TOS)
	- Stronger community by showing events for all fans
	- Open communities for all fans

How is our product better with specific scenarios or specific users?
	- Who are the users and/or what are the scenarios?
		- With numerous platforms, the fan base numbers are very scattered. With fanlinc, we can 
		connect them all under the category of fans and be open to others. For example, discord 
		can have a concentrated group of fans, but is too exclusive to others who may have the exact 
		preferences but have never gotten an invite. By keeping it open, more fans can interact with 
		each other.
		- Most of the time users are focused on one topic or subcategory that interests them. 
		By integrating more fan bases and categories, a diversified option allows to discover new interests.
		- Users allowed more freedom to set up their profiles, bio and interests
	- Why do you think the competitors didnâ€™t focus on these users and/or scenarios? 
	And, what would it take for them to do so? 
		- Some competitors are more focused for general communications in game, or some are focused 
		on providing user submitted content. Facebook is focused on their messaging system. 
		All of these competitors have their own focus for general usability, but they do not 
		completely take up the share of users from different fan bases due to the numerous platforms.
		- The goal is a fan community which is not the main intention of those big competitors. 
		This website however, is. It takes in the needs of fans to develop their preferred interface.
