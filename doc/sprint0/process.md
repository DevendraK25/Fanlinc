## Reflect on how your team worked together.
Every week we decide what needs to be worked on and distribute the tasks accordingly.
We would regularly discuss what parts needed to be implemented and then devised the most optimal way the component should be implemented.

## How did you organize the team? Which tools did you use, if any? 
To organize this team together, we showcased our strengths and weaknesses in order to see what each individual brings to this project.

## How did you make decisions?
We organize what should be our main priorities as well as voting when there is a conflict of interest.
We also frequently contact each other online to ensure everyone is working on their according tasks.

## How did you define priority and/or points of user stories? How many rounds of voting (on average) did you need to come to a consensus for the point estimate?
We first looked at what components were necessary for the development of the product. We then ranked each of the components based on how difficult and time consuming it would be to implement each part, on a scale from one to ten, with ten being the most difficult.
Then each group member would estimate how long each component would take to implement and averaged all our estimations out.
We needed to go through a maximum of 3 voting rounds in order to reach a sound conclusion.

## Did you meet in person or online?
We regularly meet in person in order to discuss our current order of business as well as to ensure everyone is one the same page.
We frequently contact each other via social media in order to remove any ambiguity when it comes to developing any components.

## How frequently did you meet? 
Constant messaging and updates online, as well as at least a meeting twice a week.

## What lessons should you take forward to the next phase?
To emphasize more time on the planning phase since some components of the project may take longer to complete than others.
